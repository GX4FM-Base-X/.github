# Gaia-X 4 Future Mobility - Welcome to Base-X üåçüöó

## About Us üìö

We develop and implement future mobility applications based on Gaia-X. This includes applications and services for manufacturing and operations, but also for the overall mobility system, such as parking management or road condition monitoring.

Together, we build an open and decentralized data and services ecosystem in which scalable applications and necessary services and data are securely provided. We are addressing IT providers and developers as well as user groups such as cities, municipalities and industrial companies.

Gaia-X 4 Future Mobility currently comprises of six projects funded by the BMWK (German Federal Ministry of Economics and Climate Protection): Gaia-X 4 AI, Gaia-X 4 AMS, Gaia-X 4 ROMS, Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD, Gaia-X 4 moveID and Gaia-X 4 AGEDA. As a project family we create the digital foundation for system innovation in the mobility sector. We are aiming to continue the groundwork and the applications beyond the projects‚Äô duration and to transfer them to other domains.
## Projects üõ†Ô∏è

- **Gaia-X 4 KI**: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key technology to develop complex technical systems for innovative mobility solutions. Gaia-X 4 KI investigates the use of Gaia-X principles for relevant AI applications in two use cases from the automotive industry: in the areas of production and for automated and connected driving (AVF).
- **Gaia-X 4 AMS**: The Gaia-X 4 AMS project provides and prototypically demonstrates data services and services around automated driving and cooperative system networking using Gaia-X.
- **Gaia-X 4 ROMS**: Gaia-X 4 ROMS ensures that innovative vehicles can be integrated into an overall data space. The project outcomes make it possible to manage centralized and decentralized large fleets and to operate them remotely to transport people and goods.
- **Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD**: Gaia-X 4 PLC-AAD (Product Life Cycle - Across Automated Driving) develops and establishes an open and distributed data ecosystem that supports future product development, manufacturing, and customer service.
- **Gaia-X 4 moveID**: Gaia-X 4 moveID addresses the technological implementation of decentralized digital identities in road traffic. It focuses on non-discriminatory access to digital services in a tightly networked infrastructure.
- **Gaia-X 4 AGEDA**: The Gaia-X 4 AGEDA project looks at applications in the edge-device automobile. The goal is a software architecture that enables data-driven applications by design and allows the dynamic adaptation of a vehicle with its functions over the entire life cycle.
